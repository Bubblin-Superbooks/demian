<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For the first time I cost death, and death tastes good bitter, because he is born, is afraid and afraid of terrible innovation.</p><p>I was glad when I was finally in my bed! Previously last Purgatory was the evening devotion passed over me, and we had to one Sung song that belonged to my dearest. Oh, I did not sing, and every sound was bile and poison to me. I did not pray when my dad said the blessing, and when he finished, "Be with us all!" Twitch me out of this circle. The grace of God was with them all, but not with me anymore. I went away cold and tired.</p><p>In bed, when I was lying awhile, as warmth and security me lovingly surrounded, my heart erred in fear again, fluttered bang for the past.</p></div> </div>
