<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>During the holidays, I once went to the house, in which years ago Max Demian had lived with his mother. An old woman was walking in the garden, I spoke to her and learned that she owned the house. I asked for the Family Demian. She remembered her well. But she did not know where she was now lived. Since she sensed my interest, she took me into the house, looked for a leather album and showed me a photograph of Demian's mother. I could barely remember her. But as I am now saw the small image, the heartbeat stopped me. -- That was mine Dream! That was her, the tall, almost male female figure, her son similar, with features of motherliness, features of severity, features of deeper Passion, beautiful and tempting, beautiful and aloof, demon and mother, Destiny and lover. That was her!</p></div> </div>
