<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I understood myself in every way with Pistorius. I just needed a lot to think him, I was sure that he or a greeting from him came to me. I could ask him, like Demian, something without himself there was: I just had to imagine him firmly and my questions as to give intense thought to him. Then everyone returned to the question given soul force in response back into me. Only it was not that Person of Pistorius, whom I imagined, and not that of Max Demian, but it was the picture I dreamed and painted, the man-feminine Dream image of my demon, which I had to call. It was not alive anymore only in my dreams, and no longer painted on paper, but in me, as a wishful image and an increase of myself.</p></div> </div>
