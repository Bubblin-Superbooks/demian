It changed Constantly, Demian held it in his hands, often it was small and gray, often big and multicolored, but he explained to me that it always came and the same thing. But at last he compelled me to eat the coat of arms. As I had swallowed it, I sensed with tremendous fright that the tangled coat of arms bird is alive in me, fill me in and from the inside begin to eat. Terrified, I woke up and woke up.</p><p>I woke up, it was the middle of the night, and heard it in the room rain. I got up to close the window and stood up something bright, lying on the ground. In the morning I found that it was my painted Leaf was. It was lying on the ground in the wet and had thrown itself in ridges. I stretched it to dry between sheets in a heavy book.</p></div> </div>
