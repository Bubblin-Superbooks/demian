<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Among other things, I often dreamed that Kromer me maltreated that he pinched me and knelt on me, and, worse, that he seduced me into serious crimes - rather, not seduced, but simply forced by its mighty influence. The most terrible of those dreams, from which I awoke half mad, contained one Murder on my father. Kromer cut a knife and handed it to me the hand, we stood behind the trees of an avenue and lurked up someone, I did not know who; but when someone came along and Kromer me by a pressure on my arm said that it is it, which I stab must, there it was my father. I woke up.</p><p>Although I thought about Cain and Abel, but little more on Demian. When he first approached me again, it was strangely enough also in a dream.</p></div> </div>
