<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Take a look such a student bar! Or even a place of entertainment, where the rich People are coming! Hopeless! - Dear Sinclair, nothing can come of that Merry ones come. These people, who are so anxious together, are full of fear and full of malice, no one dares the other. They hang on Ideals that are no more and stone everyone who sets up a new one. I sense that there are arguments. They will come, believe me, they will come soon! Of course, they will not "improve" the world. Whether the workers kill their manufacturers, or whether Russia or Germany shoot each other, only owners are exchanged. But It will not be free in vain. It will be the worthlessness of today Ideal dartun, there will be a clearing up with Stone Age gods. This world, as it is now, wants to die, it wants to perish, and she will. "</p></div> </div>
