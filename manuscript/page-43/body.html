<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> My mother had always said good night to me Her step was still in the room, the glow of her candle still glowing in the door gap. Now, I thought, now she's coming back - she she felt it, she gives me a kiss and asks, kindly and asks auspicious, and then I can cry, then the stone melts in me I'll wrap her around and tell her, and then it'll be good, then rescue is here! And when the crack in the door was already dark, I listened for a while and said it must and must happen.</p><p>Then I returned to the things and looked my enemy in the eye. I saw him clearly, one eye he had pinched, his mouth laughed raw, and as I looked at him and ate the inescapable, he grew larger and uglier, and his evil eye flashed devilishly.</p></div> </div>
