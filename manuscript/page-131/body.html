<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Read the story and check it out she is on the tongue, it is something that tastes bland. Namely the thing with the two thieves. Great, like the three crosses on the hill stand together! But now this sentimental tract story with the staid thief! First he was a criminal and has bad deeds God knows what, and now it melts away and celebrates it Weeping festivals of improvement and remorse! What is the meaning of such Repent two steps away from the grave, I beg you? It is again nothing but a true pastoral story, sweet and dishonest, with Lard of emotion and highly uplifting background. If you have one today to choose from the two thieves as friends, or to remember Whichever of you you could trust, that's it certainly not this whiny convert. No, it's the other one that is a guy and has character.</p></div> </div>
