<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I saw home and parents, father and Mother, sisters and garden, I saw my quiet native Bedroom, saw the school and the marketplace, saw Demian and the Confirmation lessons - and all this was light, everything was gleaming everything was wonderful, divine and pure, and everything, all that I had heard yesterday, hours ago, yesterday, I knew was waiting for me, and now, only now in this hour, was lost and cursed, no longer belonged to me, pushed me out, looked up with disgust me! All the love and the most heartfelt things I have ever seen, Had learned back from my parents, every kiss of the Mother, every Christmas, every pious bright Sunday morning at home, every flower in the garden - everything was devastated, I had trampled everything! If now hackers would have come and bound me and as sputum and Temple abusers led to the gallows, I would have agreed would have liked to have found it right and good.</p></div> </div>
