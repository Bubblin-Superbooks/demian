<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Tears came to my eyes. I felt that I had to get rid of myself and reached for it desperate in all my pockets. No apple, no pocket knife, even nothing was there. Then my watch came to mind. It was an old silver watch, and she did not leave, I wore her "just like that." She came from our grandmother. I quickly pulled her out.</p><p>"Kromer," I said, "Listen, you do not have to tell me, that would not be nice from you. I want to give you my watch, look there; Unfortunately, I have otherwise nothing at all. You can have her, she's made of silver, and the work is good, she has only one small mistake, you have to fix her. "</p></div> </div>
