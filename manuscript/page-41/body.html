<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> From these experiences that nobody sees, is the inner, essential line of our destiny. Such a cut and crack grows again, he is healed and forgotten, in the most secret Chamber but he lives and bleeds on.</p><p>I immediately dreaded the new feeling that I had my father Immediately after kissing the feet to interrogate him. But you can nothing essential, and that feels and knows a child so well and deep as every way.</p><p>I felt the need to think about my cause, ways to go to think tomorrow; but I did not get it. I had the whole evening only to deal with the changed air in our living room used to. Wall clock and table, bible and mirror, bookshelf and pictures The wall took leave of me as it were, I had to freeze Hearts like my world, like my good, happy life Past and I left, and had to feel like I was with new, sucking roots anchored outside in the dark and strangers and was held.</p></div> </div>
