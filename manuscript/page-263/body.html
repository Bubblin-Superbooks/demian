<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Peculiar and sometimes funny was the relationship in which the unsuccessful suicide Knauer had come to me. Since the night in the I had been sent to him, he hung on me like a faithful servant or Dog, tried to tie his life to mine and followed me blindly. With he came to me in the most weird questions and desires, wanted to see ghosts, wanted to learn the Kabbalah, and did not believe me when I assured him that I did not understand anything about all these things. He trusted me every power to. But it was strange that he often with his strange and stupid questions just came to me when there was any knot in me to solve, and that his capricious ideas and concerns often give me the cue and the impetus brought to the solution.</p></div> </div>
