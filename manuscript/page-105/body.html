<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Always these impulses came from the "other world," always scared them Compulsion and bad conscience with them, always they were revolutionary and endangered the peace in which I would have liked to stay.</p><p>There came the years in which I had to rediscover that in me even a vital urge lived in the allowed and light world itself had to hide and hide. Like every human being, so did me slowly awakening sense of sex as an enemy and destroyer, as forbidden, as seduction and sin. What my curiosity was looking for, what created dreams, desire and fear, the great secret of puberty, the did not fit into the secret bliss of my child peace. I did like everybody else. I led the double life of the child, which is not a child is more. My consciousness lived in the domestic and allowed, my Consciousness denied the dazzling new world.</p></div> </div>
