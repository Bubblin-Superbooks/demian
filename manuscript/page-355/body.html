<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One of the stars rushed straight to me with a bright sound, it seemed to look for me. - Then he crashed into a thousand sparks, yelling it yanked me up and threw me to the ground again, thunder broke the world over me together.</p><p>I was found near the poplar, covered with soil and many wounds.</p><p>I lay in a cellar, guns grumbled over me. I lay in one Cart and bumped over empty fields. Mostly I slept or was without Awareness. But the deeper I slept, the harder I felt that something drew me that I followed a force that was master over me.</p><p>I lay in a stable on straw, it was dark, someone was on me Hand kicked. But my heart wanted to go on, it pulled me more away. Again I lay on a wagon, and later on a stretcher or ladder, more and more I felt ordered somewhere, felt nothing but the Urge to finally get there.</p></div> </div>
