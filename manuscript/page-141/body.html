But he still looked very different than usual, and something went away from him, something surrounded him, which I did not know. I thought he had his eyes closed, but saw that he kept her open. They did not look, they did were not seeing, they were rigid and inward or in a great distance turned. He sat there motionless and did not seem to breathe. his mouth was cut like wood or stone. His face was pale, even pale, like stone, and the brown hair was the liveliest on him. His hands lay on the bench in front of him, lifeless and still Objects, like stones or fruits, pale and motionless, but not limp, but like solid, good wraps around a burger strong life.</p></div> </div>
