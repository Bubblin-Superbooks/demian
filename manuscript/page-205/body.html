<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The next spring I was supposed to leave high school and study go, I did not know where and what. A small grew on my lips Bart, I was a full grown man, yet totally helpless and without goals. Only one thing was certain: the voice in me, the dream picture. I felt the task of blindly following that lead. But it fell to me heavy, and daily I sat up. Maybe I was crazy, I often thought, maybe I was not like other people? But I was able to do everything that others did with a little diligence and effort I could read Plato, could solve trigonometric tasks or follow a chemical analysis. Only one thing I could not do: the in tear out my darkly hidden target and draw it somewhere in front of me, like others did it, who exactly knew that they were professor or judge, doctor or artists wanted to be how long and what benefits it would have. I couldnt do that.</p></div> </div>
