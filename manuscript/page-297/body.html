<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I slept hard until late in the morning. The new day broke for me as one solemn feast day, as I have since the Christmas celebrations of my boyhood had not experienced any more. I was full of unrest, but without any Anxiety. I felt that an important day had dawned for me, I saw and felt the world transformed around me, waiting, relational and solemn, even the quietly flowing autumn rain was beautiful, quiet and festively full of serious music. For the first time the outer world resonated my inner together - then is the holiday of the soul, then it is worth it to live. No house, no shop window, no face in the alley disturbed me, everything was as it should be, but did not carry the empty one Face of the everyday and familiar, but was waiting nature, stood Reverently ready for destiny. So I had as a little boy the World seen on the morning of the great holidays, on Christday and at Easter.</p></div> </div>
