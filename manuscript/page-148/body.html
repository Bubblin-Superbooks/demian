<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The strange emptiness and loneliness that I have during the holidays For the first time I felt my confirmation (how did I learn it to know later, this void, this thin air!), did not go so fast over. The farewell from the home was very easy, I was ashamed me, in fact, that I was not wistful, the sisters were crying groundless, I could not. I was amazed at myself. Always was I have been a soulful child, and basically a pretty good kid. Now I was completely transformed. I acted completely indifferent to the outer world, and was occupied for days only in me to listen in and hear the streams, the forbidden and dark streams, they were rustling underground in me. I grew up very quickly, only in the last half years, and looked shot, skinny and unfinished in the World. The amiability of the boy had completely disappeared from me, me I felt that I could not be loved like that, and I loved myself also by no means.</p></div> </div>
