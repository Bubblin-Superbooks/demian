To you the unheard of give, the new gods, was not his office.</p><p>And here, suddenly, like a sharp flame, the knowledge burned me: - There was an "office" for everyone, but not one that he chose, could rewrite and arbitrarily manage. It was wrong, new gods too want, it was completely wrong to want to give something to the world! There was no, no, no obligation for awakened people as the one: himself to seek, to become firm in oneself, to grope one's way forward, no matter where he went. - That shook me deeply, and that was that Fruit of this experience for me. Often I had pictures of the future played, I had dreamed of roles that could be intended for me, as a poet perhaps or as a prophet, or as a painter, or somehow. All that was nothing.</p></div> </div>
