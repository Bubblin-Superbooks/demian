<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> To this world belonged mild luster, clarity and cleanliness, here were gentle, friendly speeches, washed hands, clean clothes, good manners home. Here the morning chorale was sung, here was Christmas celebrated. In this world there were straight lines and paths leading into the future there was duty and guilt, bad conscience and confession, Forgiveness and good intentions, love and worship, Bible Word and wisdom. Our future had to belong to this world, so it had to be clear and clean, be nice and orderly.</p><p>The other world, meanwhile, began right in the middle of our own house and was completely different, smelled different, spoke differently, promised and demanded andres. In this second world, there were maidservants and craftsmen, Ghost stories and scandal rumors, there was a colorful flood of monstrous, enticing, terrible, mysterious things, things like Slaughterhouse and prison, drunks and nagging women, giving birth to cows, fallen horses, tales of burglaries, homicides, suicides.</p></div> </div>
