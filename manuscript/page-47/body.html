<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I felt bad when I put on socks in my mother's room sneaked and took my rifle from her desk; but as bad as Yesterday was not. The palpitations strangled me and it did not better, when I found in the stairwell at the first examination, that the rifle was closed. It was very easy to break it open, it was only to rip through a thin sheet metal grid; but the crack hurt, first I had committed theft. Until then, I just had a snack Sugar pieces and fruits. This now was stolen, although it was my own money was. I felt myself taking another step closer to Kromer and his World was, as it went down pretty little by little, and set defiance on the other hand. The devil might fetch me, now there was no way back. I counted the money with fear, it had sounded so full in the box, now in the hand was miserably little. There were sixty-five pennies.</p></div> </div>
