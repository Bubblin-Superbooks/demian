<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The friendly peace of those weeks and months of Beatrice was long past. At that time I meant, reached an island and a peace to have found. But it was always like that - hardly was a condition dear to me As soon as a dream had done me good, it was already withered and blind. In vain to sue him! I was living in a fire from now unfulfilled longing, of anticipated expectation that often drives me crazy and did great. I often saw the image of the dream lover with more survivors Clarity in front of me, much clearer than my own hand, spoke with he cried in front of him, cursing him. I called it mother and knelt before him in tears, I called it lover and suspected his mature, everything fulfilling kiss, I called it devil and whore, vampire and murderer. It I was tempted to tender dreams of love and despicable shamelessness, nothing was too good and delicious, nothing too bad and low.</p></div> </div>
