<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> From one day to the other I stayed away from the pubs and nocturnal forays away. I could be alone again, I read again I liked to go for a walk again.</p><p>The sudden conversion mocked me enough. But I had something now to love and worship, I had an ideal again, life was again full of hunch and colorful mysterious twilight - that made me insensitive. I was back home with myself, though only as a Slave and servant of a revered image.</p><p>I can not think of that time without a certain emotion. Again I tried with the utmost effort, from the rubble of a collapsed To build a "bright world" for me, I once again lived in that only desire to dismiss the dark and evil in me and completely in the To lighten, to kneel before gods.</p></div> </div>
