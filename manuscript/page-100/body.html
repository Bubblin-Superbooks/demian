<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I could and now he did not want to reveal Abel and help glorify Cain, now that I had become an Abel myself again.</p><p>So the external context. But the inside was this: I was from Kromers and the devil's hands redeemed, but not by my own power and Power. I had tried to walk the paths of the world, and she had been too slippery for me. Well, there the handle of a friendly Hand had saved me, I ran, without a look more to do in the womb of the mother and the security of a hideaway, pious, mild childhood back. I made myself younger, more dependent, more childlike as I was. I had to relinquish my dependence on Kromer with a new one I could not replace myself. So I chose, in my blind heart, the dependence on father and mother, on the old, beloved "bright world," of which I already knew that she not the only one. If I had not done that, I would have to Hold Demian and entrust me to him.</p></div> </div>
