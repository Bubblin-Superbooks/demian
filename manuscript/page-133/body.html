Just do not be serious! But I want to tell you something - here is one of the points where you can see the deficiency in this religion very clearly. The point is that this whole God, old and new covenant, indeed an excellent figure, but not what he really is to introduce. He is the good, the noble, the fatherly, the beautiful and also high, the sentimental - quite right! But the world is also made up others. And that is all just attributed to the devil, and this whole part of the world, this whole half is embezzled and hushed up. Just as they praise God as Father of all life, but that whole sex life on which life is based, just keep quiet and possibly for devil stuff and declare sinful! I do not have anything against worshiping this God, Jehovah, not the least.</p></div> </div>
