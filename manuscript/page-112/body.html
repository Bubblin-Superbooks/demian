<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I saw Demian's face, and I not only saw that he had no boyish face, but that of a man; I saw even more, I thought I saw, or too feel that it is not the face of a man, but something else other. It was as if there was something of a woman's face in it, and In particular, this face did not seem male to me for a moment or childish, not old or young, but somehow millennial, somehow timeless, stamped by other times as we live them. Animals could look like this, or trees, or stars - I did not know that, I did not feel exactly what I'm saying now as an adult, but something similar. Maybe he was beautiful, maybe he liked me, maybe he disliked me, too, that was impossible to decide. I just saw: he was different from us, he was like an animal, or like a ghost, or like a picture, I do not know who he was, but he was different, unimaginably different than all of us.</p></div> </div>
