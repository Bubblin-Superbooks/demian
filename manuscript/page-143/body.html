<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I barely understood that no one except me sees it! Everyone had to look, everyone had to startle! But no one paid attention to him. He sat pictorial and, like I had to think, strangely idolatrous, a fly sat up his forehead, ran slowly over his nose and lips - he jerked no fold.</p><p>Where, where was he now? What did he think, what did he feel? Was he in a sky in a hell?</p><p>I was not able to ask him about it. When I see him, at the end of Hour, living again and breathing, when his eyes met mine, he was like in old times. Where did he come from? Where was he? He seemed tired. His face again had color, his hands moved again, but the brown hair was now lackluster and as tired.</p></div> </div>
