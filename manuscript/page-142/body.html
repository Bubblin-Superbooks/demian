<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The sight made me tremble. He is dead! I thought, almost I said it loud. But I knew he was not dead. I hung with a banned look on his face, on that pale, stone mask, and I felt that was Demian! What he was like when he went with me and spoke, that was just a half Demian, one who played a role at times, himself comfortable, as a compliment. The real Demian looked like like this, so stony, ancient, animalistic, stony, beautiful and cold, dead and secretly full of unheard of life. And around him this quiet emptiness, this ether and starry space, this lonely death!</p><p>"Now he's completely absorbed in himself," I felt shivering. Never I had been so lonely. I did not participate in him, he was mine out of reach, he was further away from me than when he was on the farthest island of the World would have been.</p></div> </div>
