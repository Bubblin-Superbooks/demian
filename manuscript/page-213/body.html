He was sitting at the bar in a corner of the small parlor, the black felt hat on the head, a pint of wine in front himself, and his face was as I expected. It was ugly and a little bit wild, searching and stubborn, stubborn and willful, all the while the mouth is soft and childish. The male and the strong sat everything in eyes and forehead, the lower part of the face was tender and unfinished, uncontrolled and in part soft, the chin was filled with indecision boyish there as a contradiction to forehead and look. I loved them dark brown eyes, full of pride and hostility.</p><p>Silently, I sat down opposite him, nobody else was in the pub. He flashed at me as if to chase me away.</p></div> </div>
