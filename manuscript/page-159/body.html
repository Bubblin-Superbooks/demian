<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>So I looked inwardly! I, who walked around and despised the world! I, who was proud in spirit and thought thoughts Demians! That's how I looked, a spit and pig's egg, drunk and dirty, disgusting and mean, a wild beast, surprised by terrible impulses! That's how I looked, I who came out of those gardens where all purity, splendor, and sweet delicacy was, I who loved Bach music and beautiful poems! I I still heard with disgust and outrage my own laughter, a drunken, uncontrolled, stuttering and silly breaking out laughter. That was me!</p><p>Despite everything, it was almost a pleasure to suffer these torments. So long I was blind and dull-witted, my heart had so long sat silent and impoverished in an angle, that these self-accusations, this horror, this whole hideous feeling of the soul was welcome.</p></div> </div>
