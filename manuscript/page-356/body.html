Now I was in a hall, laid out on the floor, and felt that I was there, where I am was called. I looked around, there was one right next to my mattress andre, and someone on her, leaned over and looked at me. He had the sign on the forehead. It was Max Demian.</p><p>I could not speak, and he too could not or did not want to. He saw just me. On his face was the light of a traffic light above him hung on the wall. He smiled at me.</p><p>For an infinitely long time, he kept looking me in the eyes. Slowly pushed He kept his face closer to me until we almost touched each other.</p></div> </div>
