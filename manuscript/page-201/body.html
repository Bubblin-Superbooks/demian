I also searched an entire library unsuccessfully through the Abraxas. But my being was never strong in this way of life adjusted to direct and conscious searching, whereby one mostly only truths finds that remain in the hands of a stone.</p><p>The figure of Beatrice, with whom I spend so much time for a while and was deeply absorbed, now gradually sinking, or rather she slowly stepped away from me, approaching the horizon more and more and became more shadowy, farther, paler. It was not enough for the soul more.</p><p>It began now in the strangely self-centered existence, that I led like a dreamwalker to create a new education. The Longing for life blossomed in me, rather the yearning for love, and the instinct of sex that I had for a while in worship Beatrices can resolve, demanded new images and goals.</p></div> </div>
