<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I begin my story with an experience of the time where I am about was ten to eleven years old and went to the Latin school of our town.</p><p>Much smells me there and touches me from the inside with pain and with pleasant showers, dark streets and bright, houses and towers, clockwork and people's faces, rooms full of comfort and warmth, rooms full of mystery and deep ghost fear. It smells of warmth, after rabbits and maidservants, after home remedies and dried fruit. Two worlds were mixed up there, from two Poles came day and night Night.</p><p>The one world was the father's house, but it was even closer, it included actually only my parents. For the most part, this world was well known to me, her name was Mother and Father, her name was Love and Strictness, Model and School.</p></div> </div>
