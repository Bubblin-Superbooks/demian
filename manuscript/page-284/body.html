Once, in Zurich, a woman hired me pretty, somewhat naughty woman. I hardly saw her and walked on, as if she breathes. I would rather have died immediately than to another woman would have participated for only one hour.</p><p>I felt that my fate was pulling me, I felt that the fulfillment was near I was, and I was mad with impatience that I could not do anything about it. Once at a train station, I think it was in Innsbruck, I saw in a plane Moving train at the window a figure that reminded me of her, and was unhappy for days. And suddenly the figure appeared to me again at night in a dream, I awoke with a shy and dull feeling from the futility of my hunt, and went straight home back.</p></div> </div>
