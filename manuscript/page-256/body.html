<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At night I woke up from a deep sleep, I was in the clothes and lay across the bed. I lit the light, felt myself open Important to remember, knew nothing more of the hours before. I Light lit, the memory came gradually. I searched the picture, it no longer hung on the wall, nor was it on the table. I thought so to think darkly that I had burned it. Or was it a dream I burned it in my hands and ate the ashes would have?</p><p>A big, twitching restlessness drove me. I put on my hat, went through House and alley, as under duress, ran and ran through streets and over As if blown by a storm, listened to the dark church of mine Friend, searched and searched in a dark shoot, without knowing what. I came through a suburb where whores stood, there was still here and there Light.</p></div> </div>
