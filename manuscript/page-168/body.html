I had him, at the beginning of my student days in St., written twice, but got no answer; that's why I had not visited during the holidays.</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>In the same park where I met Alfons Beck in the fall, It happened in the early spring, just as the thorn hedges turn green started that a girl noticed me. I was walking alone, full of disgusting thoughts and worries, for my health was bad, and besides, I was constantly in financial trouble, owed comrades sums, had to invent necessary editions to to get something back from home, and had bills in several stores grow up for cigars and similar things. Not that worried would have gone very deep - if next time my being here its end took and I went into the water or was taken to the reformatory, then it did not matter to these little things. But I lived but always in eye with such ugly things, and suffered.</p></div> </div>
