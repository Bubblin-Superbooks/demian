<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This cult of Beatrice changed my life completely. Yesterday one more premature cynic, I was now a temple servant, with the goal of one To become a saint. I did not just kill the bad life that I am I tried to change everything, sought purity, nobility and dignity into everything, thought of it in food and drink, language and Dress. I started the morning with cold ablutions, which I did myself had to force hard at first. I behaved serious and worthy, carried me upright and made my walk slower and more dignified. For viewers like it looked weird - with me inside it was just worship.</p><p>Of all the new exercises in which I express my new sentiments was looking for, one became important to me. I started to paint. It started with that the English Beatrice picture I owned was not like that girl was enough. I wanted to try painting it for myself.</p></div> </div>
