<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For a year or more that was going on, including the first vacation visits Home brought no new sounds; I like to go away again.</p><p>It was at the beginning of November. I had got used to it in all weathers to make small, witty walks, on which I often have some kind of Enjoyed bliss, a bliss full of melancholy, world contempt and Self-loathing. So I strolled one evening in the damp, misty Twilight by the surroundings of the city, the wide avenue of a public Parkes stood completely abandoned and invited me, the way was thick and full fallen leaves in which I dug my feet with dark voluptuousness, it smelled damp and bitter, the distant trees were eerily large and shadowy from the mists.</p></div> </div>
