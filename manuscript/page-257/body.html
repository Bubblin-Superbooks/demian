<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Further out were new buildings and brick piles, some with gray ones Snow covered. I fell as I am like a dreamwalker under a stranger Pressure through this desert drove in, the new building in my native city, in which my tormentor Kromer once told me about our first reckoning had pulled. A similar structure lay before me in the gray night, yawned at me with a black door hole. It pulled me in, I wanted Dodge and stumble over sand and debris; the urge was stronger, me had to go inside.</p><p>Over boards and broken bricks, I staggered into the desert Room, it smelled cloudy of damp cold and stones. A pile of sand lay there, a bright gray spot, otherwise everything was dark.</p></div> </div>
