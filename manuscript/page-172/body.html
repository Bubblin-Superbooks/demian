There could be nothing sinister, nothing ugly, none pierced nights, no palpitations against lewd images, no Listening to forbidden doors, no lewdness. Instead of everything I arranged my altar, with the image of Beatrice, and by myself I consecrated to the spirit and the gods. The proportion of life, When I withdrew from the dark forces, I sacrificed myself to the light. Not lust was my goal, but purity, not happiness, but beauty and spirituality.</p></div> </div>
