"If you only knew!" I thought, feeling like one Criminal being interrogated for a stolen bread while he is Murders would have to confess.

Maybe, I thought, Kromer has already gone to the police and has specified me, and Thunderstorms gather over me as one here like me considered a small child!</p><p>From this whole experience, as far as it is told up to this, was this Moment the important and lasting. It was a first crack in the Holiness of the Father, it was a first cut in the pillars on which my child life had rested, and every man, before he himself can, must have destroyed.</p></div> </div>
