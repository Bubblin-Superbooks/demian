<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I was carrying dirt on my feet, not on the mat I brought shade with me, of which the homeworld did not know. How many secrets I had already had, how much Anxiety, but it was all fun and games against what I did Today brought with me in these rooms. Fate ran after me, hands were stretched out to me, from which even the mother does not protect me she could not know about. Whether my crime Theft was or a lie (I did not have a false oath to God and blessedness sworn?) - that did not matter. My sin was not this or that, my sin was that I shook hands with the devil. Why did I go with you? Why had I obeyed Kromer, better than ever? my father? Why had I lied the story of that theft? Barking at me with crimes as if they were heroic deeds? Now he stopped Devil my hand, now the enemy was after me.</p></div> </div>
