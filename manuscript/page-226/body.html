Rather, it is it is the same indivisible deity that works in us and in nature, and if the outer world were lost, one of us would be able to do it to rebuild, because mountain and stream, tree and leaf, root and blossom, Everything educated in nature is prefigured in us, comes from the Soul whose essence is eternity, whose essence we do not know, that is ours but mostly as love power and creativeness.</p><p>Only a few years later I once found this observation in a book confirmed by Leonardo da Vinci, who once spoke of it as well and deeply inspiring it is to look at a wall, which many people has been spat.
