The church was almost completely dark, only a very thin light shone through the next window. I waited until the music was over and stroked then up and down until I saw the organist come out. It was still one young man, but older than me, stocky and stocky in shape, and he ran away quickly, with strong and almost unwilling steps.</p><p>Sometimes, from then on, I sat in front of the church in the evening, or went upstairs and from.
