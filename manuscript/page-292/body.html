The People flee to each other because they are afraid of each other - the gentlemen for themselves, the workers for themselves, the scholars for themselves! And why have are you scared? One is only afraid if one is not in agreement with oneself. you are afraid because they have never made themselves known to themselves. A Community of all people who are in front of the unknown in themselves Be scared! They all feel that their laws of life are no longer right, that they live according to old tables, neither their religions nor theirs Morality, none of everything is appropriate to what we need. Europe has only studied and factories for hundreds and more years built! They know exactly how many grams of powder one needs Killing people, but they do not know how to pray to God, they know not even how to be happy for an hour.</p></div> </div>
